# [Wordle Web Application](https://final-exam-yoqpwdjonq-uc.a.run.app/home)

This is a clone of the popular daily word guessing game "Wordle" that I produced in my Web Development course. However, my implementation has a grid size of 'nxn', where n is the length of the word of the day.

I take use of Beautiful Soup web scraping to get a new word every day, and WordsAPI to validate each of the user's guesses as english words. The website is built with HTML, CSS, & JS and utilizes Flask, mySQL, and Jinja to route/store/display backend data to the user. The website also supports users making their own (fully encrypted) account, which lets the leaderboard display all of the users' top scores of the day.
